# Aprendendo-Learning

Being honest i am watching a beginner course of Javascript on Youtube.
So basically i am copying the pag in order to learn, but somethings that 
i'm not likeng in the original pag i'm changing, adding some features that makes me happier.
In resume is a pag that will introduce four or five Challenges and this pag has a good interaction
between html,css and Javascript.
This project is perfect for who wants to learn this integration and learning the basics of JavaScript.
